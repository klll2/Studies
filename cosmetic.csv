This product exceeded all of my expectations, it's actually the first makeup that I buy back-ups of. I have fairly persistent acne problems (I'm 25), it has always been an issue finding a product that I can wear to look like I gave a crap about myself without looking like I was covered in makeup (light but durable coverage has always been an issue). One of my friends recommended it to me, well went passed recommending and was raving about how amazing it is. I was happy to comply, she has flawless skin. I rarely wear actual foundation, concealer, or powder anymore, unless I'm going out somewhere I've got to tart myself up a bit. I noticed a change in my bare facial complexion within days. My skin brightened up, my acne is pretty much eliminated (has no alcohol, benzo, other acne treatments in it), and my skin was noticeably soft and hydrated. Initially when I first began wearing it, I would use two layers (because of my acne), I now use what I would consider about half of a layer, very minimal coverage. For longer wear, I recommend adding an extra layer than you usually would. Something I really love about it is when you put it on, it has a kind of cooling feeling, and with this less really is more as far as application goes. When layering, allow to completely absorb into skin before applying an extra layer (for longer wear). Or you can always totally just touch up later, I just usually never have time once I'm out the door to get near a mirror or sneak off for a couple of minutes. I was able to hydrate my skin (had to day/night because of my acne treatments that would dry out my skin), without having to use daily moisturizer. I know it is a little pricey, the product on here is actually less than BareMinerals the last time I checked, but if you want to give it a shot and decide that it isn't quite the product for you, I highly recommend keeping it on hand and using it for beach days or situations like that when you may want a lighter coverage that has SPF included. When the product first launched, they hand't released a full range of colors yet. If you're unsure if this is the right shade for you, I recommend visiting the BareMinerals website, they have a color chart. I went on there and then just came on here and searched for the specific shade I was matched with there. Last I checked in, they have at least 25 listed. One last thing worth mentioning, I don't wear mine with powder, but the friend that recommended it does her entire facial makeup routine (blush, translucent powder) with hers and it looks great still.",I can't express how much I love this product,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2016",TRUE,5

But I wanted to try the Drunk Elephant products since I heard such high praise about them, and this was a good way to try out several products before I invest in an expensive bottle of any of these.Well, once again I was taught a lesson of leaving something for later. Three months after my purchase, I tried to day serum and nothing came out. I was puzzled but let it go, and used the other bottles. Today I finally broke it open to see what's going on-- I thought it was just not pumping right-- and all I found was a bit of dry white powder at the bottom. The entire bottle dried up.Thankfully, the others did work and I can say that I do like them, although I'm not entirely sure why they'd be superior to other, less expensive, organic products. It's probably due to high quality ingredients but still, the price is way up there. The face cream is pleasant and smooth, as is the night serum. The oil helped me quite a bit when my skin was flaking due to exfoliation serums. I didn't try the foundation since I don't use such products but I'll see if I can add it to a powdered face mask (I think that would work-- need to find out.) What else? Oh, the scrub gel. It seems gentle enough when my skin is being sensitive (again, due to trying exfoliating serums.)Overall... hmm. If I was rich I guess I'd purchase this due to the high quality ingredients. But I don't have extra money to spend on a bit of serum and cream that's gone quickly. You CAN use small amounts so it doesn't vanish quickly, but still.

Drunk elephant is a okay brand, stuff a little over priced and the things are functional. My lil moisturizer felt cool and great however came with scratch’s and scuffs on the container. Not to mention there was like a big air bubble in it meaning I got less of the amount ;-;. Bag was cool but also had scuffs. The orange one, yes I forgot wut it was called irritated my skin a little but was alright I guess. Everything else worked fine but nothing about this kit really stand out. I never really had acne unless I ate unhealthy stuff the other day but I got acne soon after idk if it was the exams or another product I was using but I still have it to this time I’m writing this review. Drunk elephant is just expensive looks ay okay and meh normal i guess. Not awful but it’s nothing special. Kit was cool and gave me a feel of their products with me intro into skincare.

This SKII Essence has been A HG(Holy Grail) product that I have been using for for several years, but this is the first time I have ordered it from Amazon. Upon arrival, I inspected the bottle/ packaging. I've always purchased the set, because it's about the same price as the single bottle, so the box was different from what I typically use. The bottle looks exactly the same. I checked for the seal and it was there. I've been using it ,and I haven't noticed anything different in the quality, smell, texture ect. that I noticed another review mentioned. I double cleanse, Then I apply an AHA Toner. After that, I apply This SKII Essence with my fingertips, because at this price point I don't want to loose a single drop on a cotton pad. Then I apply my Serum and lotion on top. I was out of the essence for a bit before I ordered it this time, and I noticed a difference. Without daily use of this product,my face became really dry and dull. Now my face is Happy again!

Unfortunately, in my youth there was this myth that skin-care oil was not healthy for facial skin.  The best lines of cosmetics were touted as superior because they were oil free.  I spent most of my adult life tolerating dry skin, and wasting money on moisturizers and other skin products that were encumbered with chemicals, parabens, and different preservatives.  Some of these products would occasionally irritate my skin.  Lifelong myths are had to dismiss, but this year I had decided to broaden my horizons concerning skin care products and started experimenting with different oils for my beauty care routine.  This has opened up a brand new realm.  I have now bought and used the following facial oils; Almond, Argan, Avocado, Castor, Olive, Walnut and Vitamin E and all of these oils have worked well.  However, Fresh Seaberry Moisturizing Face Oil has provided my skin with the most Remarkable, Dramatic and Effective results of all.The Seaberry Oil uses an eyedropper dispenser vial that reaches all the way to the very bottom of the bottle, so there will not be any waste, unlike most dispenser vials, that only reach down about 80%.The fragrance is unique, I am unable to explain it, an earthy clean scent, something like the fresh smell of the earth after a drenching spring rain.  I really like it; I find it calming instead of the sweet floral or fruity scents that I am used to in many other skin care products.I have been using Seaberry Oil for about five weeks and I use it twice daily, in the mornings; first my vitamin c serum, HA (hyaluronic acid), and then the Seaberry Oil.  I only need 3 – 4 drops for both my face and neck, and my skin absorbs this lightweight oil immediately.  Then in the evenings; first I use my derma roller, followed by my vitamin c serum, the HA, and finish off with a few drops of Seaberry Oil.  The Seaberry Oil soothes, calms, and augments the healing process after the derma roll session, with a much-needed increase of moisture.After five weeks usage of the Seaberry Oil, these are my results in conjunction with the derma roll sessions, vitamin c serum, and HA.  My skin tone and texture is much smoother, softer and my facial skin is noticeably firmer.I now use very little make-up, as I no longer feel the necessity to cover-up my skin with foundation.  After my sunscreen, I only require a touch of blush or bronzer, eyeliner, mascara and lip-gloss.  Fresh Seaberry Moisturizing Oil keeps my face soft, supple, hydrated, and moisturized, providing dewy fresh naturalness without any shiny residue.  I will continue with my other oils as they have extraordinary benefits for my body and my hair, but when it comes to facial moisturizing oils, Seaberry Oil is now my number #1!",My Favorite Face Oil…I now look Better WITHOUT Make-Up !,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2014",TRUE,5

I have had so many people compliment me and ask me what I'm doing different, and I tell them about this.  Many don't accept the idea of an oil being used as a moisturizer, particularly if they have oily skin.

It's perfect for this cold winter weather, and a little goes a very long way, so be careful about how much you use because too much will leave you greasy. For instance, I think a pea sized amount might be too much on my face, but my skin is pretty well moisturized for the most part so if you're dryer a pea size might be just right for you. Still, always a good idea to start with a little and build up to avoid wasting product. I use this mainly on the areas I'm concerned about wrinkles forming or that are a bit dry (I have combo skin) like my forhead, brow, laugh lines, lips and nose, then apply my regular moisturizer on top. I also use it as a night time neck cream and on itchy, dry legs and it helped greatly. All in all, very good product at a good price point, especially for the amount you get.

I heard of this product from social media from a well known makeup/skincare influencer and thought I’d give it a try since they were adamant it was a great product to use. I’m not going to lie, at first it felt great and it definitely felt like my skin was absorbing the product. Fast forward to a week or two after using this, my skin started to bump up a lot around my cheeks and mouth, this had never happened previous to me using this cream.

I have used over 15 jars of this so I know the product incredibly well. I usually purchase directly from the FAB website or at Sephora and Ulta stores, but decided to try buying on Amazon for convenience. Overall, the smell was slightly off where it was overbearingly sweet and sugary rather then a hint of coconut. When applied it felt very waxy and thick and sat on my skin. It also needed to be rubbed and worked in instead of the usual water and lightweight texture that soaks in right away. The biggest giveaway was when the product dried down, it began to flake and pill like never before. I basically had to wet my hands and massage it back into my skin so it could set correctly.

That said, I do believe this is helpful for a lot of skin issues.I think my skin is a little drier, so I’m working on finding the right combo of moisturizers and proper steps to help remedy this.IMPORTANT NOTE: Be careful not to mix certain other skincare products or ingredients with it (no matter what the website may say!).To be helpful, I have made a list of things NOT to mix at the same time and important tips.However, to be sure, ask a professional dermatologist:•DO NOT MIX:-RETINOL should not be mixed with: Vitamin C, Vitamin E, AHA/BHA or Benzol Peroxide.-AHA/BHA should not be mixed with: Retinol, Vitamin C or Niacinamide (and possibly peptides but I am not 100% sure on that).-VITAMIN C should not be mixed with Retinol, AHA/BHA or Niacinamide.-VITAMIN E should not be mixed with Retinol.-NIACINAMIDE should not be mixed with AHA/BHA or Vitamin C-BENZOYL PEROXIDE should not be mixed with Retinol.NOTE: Both Retinol and AHA/BHA can be very helpful for various skin issues. While you should not MIX them, you can switch between them (example: Monday for Retinol, Tuesday for AHA/BHA, etc) nightly once your skin has been safely worked up to tolerating these more intense skin remedies. Do not try to do this all at once, right off the bat.•SUN AND CARE:-While the Drunk Elephant website doesn’t always address this, in most cases RETINOL and AHA/BHA should be used at night as they cause sensitivity to the sun that can damage skin. I don’t know if applying sunscreen will fully keep your skin safe (not to mention all the reapplying). While you *may* be able to use it if you’re staying indoors, do understand that harmful rays can enter the home, car and workplace through windows. If you’re going to experience sun, regardless of what you do or do not put on your skin, an SPF of at least 30 should be an everyday routine (with reapplying).As for if you stay indoors, away from windows, one would assume hanging out in a dark room all day would suffice, but I’m no expert.-So it’s beat to use Retinol and AHA/BHA at night and wash it off in the morning. A cream or serum containing Vitamin C thrives off sunlight, so that is best to use in the daytime.•IF YOU OVERDO THE SKIN TREATMENTS AND YOUR SKIN IS FEELING DRY OR IRRITATED: Take a break from the harsh products and use very gentle ones for a little bit. Particularly CERAMIDES. These are gentle and help your skin to heal, calm and moisturize your skin. I personally have used (and liked) “Good Cera Super Ceramide Emulsion (pH 5.5 / 7 free)” which is a nice, gentle moisturizer. There are also things like ceramide masks that can help.","So Far, So Good (& info on what  not to mix & how to fix skin if irritated by products)","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020",TRUE,4

It’s a nice gel texture and layers well with my other skincare products.I just need to ensure I use it in moderation and on non-retinol nights. I will have to figure out where it fits into my routine when I switch to a Tretinoin + Azelaic Acid formula (I currently use OTC Adapalene).Overall I definitely recommend it, and highly suggest getting it on Amazon vs from Sephora as it’s less than a third of the price here.

I stopped for 1 week, then decided to use it again, but that time, it was continuously and I ignored the burn. I had severe acne back then, but 3 months later, all those severe acne are gone and it's all scars now, but no more bumps/whiteheads whatsoever! My acne scars went from red to dark and is now in the process peeling off which means it is now in the exfoliating mode. I have a before and after picture of my acne but I will not post it for now. Also, it smoothed my skin out and even out the tone. Though the bad thing is that it burns and gets your face dry, so I recommend applying a non-comedogenic moisturizer such as Aveeno.

As for negatives:  It is pricey for such a small bottle and I don't really understand the point of the eye dropper, other than the fact that the bottle is glass, so it can not be squeezed.  The eye dropper makes it possible to suck up the product and get it out of the bottle, but only a little bit at a time.  Also, the bottle is opaque so I can never tell when I am running low.

Before using this product, My face had a few dark marks from cystic acne and one 1.5 inch scar that was very red and noticeable. Almost immediately the inflammation from these marks reduced considerably, to such a degree that even my husband began complimenting me regularly (I hadn't told him I was using it, because I was working up the courage to fess up about the price!). I apply it in the morning and, because I have very dry skin, find the oiliness evaporates within the hour. It has a slightly orange tint, which seems to give my very pale skin a little color. Not like an orange fake tan, just a slight tint of color to hide the pastiness that usually presents itself around mid-January. If you have oily skin, however, you may prefer to apply it at night, in which case you couldn't enjoy the benefit of this color boost. I have never noticed a fishy smell, although my sense of smell is not very strong. I can say that I am a student, and none of my costudents have moved seats to get away from me or even scooted their chairs just a little bit away from me since my having commenced use of the product. In fact, people continue to gravitate toward me, which I can only surmise is due to my sparkling personality. Its definitely not the phone full of adorable baby pictures. Although my babies are really cute. in fact, perhaps my glowing complexion has slightly increased my popularity. It's tough to say, I was already pretty popular. And did I mention that I'm extraordinarily humble? Because I definitely am. In conclusion, the product is awesome, has improved my complexion to a noticeable degree, thus increasing my confidence, perhaps even making me an all around better person. Have a great day!Update - Still adore the product. Just want to point out that it can be purchased for $8 cheaper on Sephora.

At first I was a bit skeptical about using it because I’ve seen it on Instagram so many times just scrolling through I thought it was just another product that didn’t work for my face. I have very sensitive skin. So sensitive that if I go out in the sun and I forget to put sunscreen on my face I get sunburned on my cheeks. No you know the say oh black people don’t get sunburned. Well it’s not true. It maybe because of my Asian side but my family is from south east Asia. And my mom never burns she just gets darker so I guess the genetics of bad skin skipped both of my parents and brothers and gave it to me lol. By that besides the point. I switched up my daily and night time facial regiment. And I’m telling you the results are amazing! Before I put on my curology facial treatment I put on the sand and sky mask. Wait for 10 and then my curology treatment and a moisturizer go to bed and let it do it’s magic. When I wake up I do notice a bit of an inflamed face only because of the detox in sand and sky. It only last for about a day. I will take the sacrifice because it truly gives my gives my face a soft natural glow! My friends even noticed the difference from two months ago! I really like how it gets rid of all of my blackheads! I used to have a lot and was not a pretty sight. But if you are willing to try this product out and are willing to sacrifice a day then it’s worth buying. I don’t buy a lot of stuff online because I need to watch what I use for my face because it’s prone to breakout at any moment. Plus everyone that talked about it on instagram already had clear skin! And I’m sitting there thinking well they already have clear and flawless skin why the hell do I need to buy this crap? It’s obviously not made for a person with my skin type! But I was wrong! This definitely detoxes the skin and closes up your pores. The only product that I have found to actually work with my skin instead of against it like many other products I have used in the past.I would like to point out that it is best to use it at night time before bed in my opinion to give your skin time.

When I realized it was gone, I looked at the Coola line because I like their other products. Found this face sunblock for $32 (this could be 1/3 of the Epionce, certainly 1/2) and have used it for the past few weeks playing golf. So far, so good! I'm not noticing any color, certainly no burn. No irritation, and the scent is quite mild, only noticeable when it's first applied (IMO, and I'm pretty sensitive to scents). I really like that Coola has the Hawaii reef-safe designation, which I think is very important for all sunscreens, even when we're not going swimming in the ocean. As a friend pointed out to me once, even if you don't swim in the ocean, you go home and take a shower and all those chemicals wash down the drain and make their way eventually through the system, so might as well just not use them in the first place! Yes, it's more expensive using products like this, but IMO it's worth it. I also wear sun sleeves these days so I don't have to use as much sunscreen when I'm out on the golf course. Editing this to say that this product has avobenzone, which is actually not so great and may be banned in Hawaii by next year. Hmm.

It also says not to use your facial muscles stay expressionless for the time it is on my face which is hard to do unless looking in a mirror the whole time because you don’t realize how much you use your forehead muscles and muscles around your mouth. But after applying the product I can feel it start to tighten my skin esp to forehead and around my mouth and such a good feeling knowing it is working and after 10 mins and wiping the white residue off I look in the mirror and see a difference in the wrinkles and bags under my eyes. It says you can use as a mask by applying thick amount and let set for an hour before wiping off (don’t wash off only wipe with damp washcloth or face wipe) but I haven’t tried the mask. I still have bags under my eyes and some wrinkles to my forehead and around my mouth but has taken years to get them so only natural it will take a while using this product to reduce them to a point that I am comfortable with. This product has no smell and not sticky or gooey. When applying be fast because when it starts to dry it kind of rolls up the white residue and becomes flaky as it dries. But not bad. I would recommend this product. I use day and at bedtime. It also makes my face feel smooth and soft after wiping off the white residue. The only thing is I wonder when I wipe off the white residue if I am wiping off all the product. But since it is working I would say no. I would give it five stars but the white residue has to be wiped off after leaving it on and if you miss any then looks funny on your face esp if you leave your house to go to work or to the store.

I’m not getting paid for this review. I have heavy bags under my eyes and I am always looking for products to help with that. If this review helps someone, I’m happy with that.So, I was previously using a product called instantly ageless and I like this better. It works exactly the same way but you get way more product in this bottle for a much cheaper price! A box of 25 vials of instantly ageless costs $70. I would always try to make the vials last more than once because they were so expensive, but with this product you don’t have to because you have a giant tube of it!!As for the application process, here is my first impression.First of all the back of the tube says to apply on a clean face. 😒 I don’t know about you, but I’mNot going to wear this without make-up. What’s the point??I came home and started applying it over a full face of make-up because I’m bad like that.😈I tried one eye with heavy application, and the other eye with a light application. I ended up liking the heavy better for one reason only. (check out my photos) on the light application when I smiled, you could see the plastic face wrinkles that look totally unnatural. The heavy application side did not wrinkle at all!The bottom picture is the left eye with light application and no make-up, right eye with make-up and heavy application. The top left eye is my bare eye with no make-up or product so you can see I really do have eye bags!Honestly, I saw results every way I tried it.As for the white residue, I honestly can’t say what causes it. Sometimes I have none and other times it is bad. Since it was under my eyes I found that lightly dabbing around the perimeter with a wet rag helped and then I used loose powder over it. Not a huge deal since you are always trying to lighten the under eye area. Getting the tightened part wet seems to kind of melt it and ruin the tightening of it altogether so don’t do that.Pretty much it’s just like other make-up. You have to experiment and see what is going to work on your face. If it looks bad, take it off and try it again. It’s not the end of the world. Just don’t slap it on in a rush and get all mad when it looks like crap. You get out of it what you put into it. I really feel like if you have something like eye bags, it’s really worth giving this product a try. It’s not going to fix the eye bags (that’s a whole different story for another time) however, it may make you feel better about them. I have been insecure about my inherited eye bags for several years. Ageing makes them worse. Aside from plastic surgery, this is the next best Fix!****update after using for a few days***I have definitely had a few battles with this stuff over the past few days. Here is what I have found. If you are going to apply it over make-up only use a very light layer of foundation. Using concealer or anything heavy had catastrophic results. Also, I only apply to the area I want tightened. Smearing it all over the vicinity seems to cause more white residue. Using a brush is really the way to go. I think the white residue is due to Using too much product. Concentrate all the products in your problem area. I also believe fanning it is a bad idea. I used to fan my instantly ageless to hurry along the process, however I think fanning causes the product to have a cracking appearance that is hard to cover with loose powder. Be patient and wait the full dry time!I’m still working through the kinks and am looking forward to being able to apply this one time and get it right instead of three!",Play with it!

I am not sure why my face is like this? I even had a brain scan to see if I had had a stroke, and no, I hadn't. So anyway I  had tried the eyelift cream made by this company and it worked great. I put a little of it on my face and OMG it worked, so I thought I'd buy this that is for your face and I am not disappointed. I am soon to be 67yrs old and have two sisters older than I am and neither have this problem, so yah, it was bothersome. The other day I went to lunch with one of them and she said what kind of makeup are you wearing? You look beautiful! I can't see any wrinkles. Well I told her what I had used on the right-side of my face, Which is called Tarte, but I kept the left side my little secret, well for now anyway. I can't seem to get my make up to blend in with it yet with good results but I've only been working with it for a couple days now. It looks even when I'm done even though I don't put make up on the left side. I do put a little powder on both sides, which I think evens it out. It lasts about 6 hours and when I go to wash it all off it still doesn't look real noticeable, but I can tell it's losing it's tightness. I have seen a post on here where people say it's not working, well here's probably why it's not. First of all before you squeeze it out of the tube give it a good shaking with the cap still on of course. I didn't do that the first time and it came out clear and watery looking. I put it on and thought, well that's not as good as the eye cream. Then I remembered I had shook the eye cream lol. So then I shook it and it was thicker and worked great.
